# ðŸ’¼ Resume Website â€“ Capstone Project 1

A simple personal resume website built with only HTML as part of Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Web Development Bootcamp.

## âœ¨ Project Overview

This is the first capstone project in the course, designed to test basic understanding of HTML structure, tags, and semantic layout. It features a mock personal resume with:

## ðŸ“„ What I Used

- File structure: `index.html`, images folder
